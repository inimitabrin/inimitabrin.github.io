    <p>When I was five, I wanted to be everything. A doctor, an actor, a warrior elf princess—there were so many possibilities, and I wanted a piece of every part. As I grew older, my dream changed—at age eight I wanted to be a spy, at age ten a surgeon, at age sixteen a history teacher, and at age eighteen a forensic psychologist. Yet, here I am at twenty-two a UX designer. How exactly, you may be wondering, did that come about? The short answer is that it’s the culmination of everything that I love—art, computers, and psychology—but there is a longer story as well.<br><br>Like all good stories, it begins with a question: How do I understand people?<br><br>As a child, I spent a lot of time stuck in my head pondering the fantastic, but I spent even more time wondering how to understand the people around me. For some time, I was under the mistaken impression it was the sort of skill you either had or you didn’t—a kind of lottery of interpersonal prowess.<br><br>I can’t remember the precise moment I had a revelation, but I do know that at some point I realized that, if you could study other subjects, why not people? That was when I began the practice of observing those around me.<br><br>Other interests came and went, but this persistent need to understand others lasted. Accordingly, when it came time to decide on a major, I went with psychology. There, I learned formal research skills and principles of human behavior. I also had a second major for a while learning 2D Design, where I studied art and the foundations of making beautiful things. However, something still felt incomplete. I knew I liked research, I knew that I liked design, and I knew I liked learning about people, but I wasn’t able to apply any of that in a meaningful way.<br><br>I graduated, but it wasn’t until I found out about UX research that I was able to find any kind of direction. I did some research on the subject and immediately fell in love. UX combines psychology, design, and computers—three of my favorite things—and its application helps real people with their problems.<br><br>I looked for online UX programs and came across Bloc, which gave me a mentor under whom I could learn UX fundamentals and build a portfolio. Throughout the process, my love for the field has not waned. I finally feel like I’ve found my place in the world—and while I may not be able to be everything, I think in the end I can be everything that matters to me.<br><br>And really, that’s about as happy an ending as you can get.</p>
