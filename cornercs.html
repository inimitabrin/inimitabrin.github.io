      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>With countless items requiring our attention being thrown at us every day, old systems of collecting and organizing data are not always up to the immense task given them. Corner seeks to provide a clean and simple way of bringing together and sorting notes, pictures, and links that inspire and motivate.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="problem" class="contentitem">
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>The abundance of material available to anyone with access to a computer and an Internet connection means that any method to compile the material you want to revisit and share must be robust and easy to organize. However, current methods--note-taking apps and browser bookmarks, for example--quickly become cluttered, which means it’s hard to find the things you want to find, and don’t stay updated.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="solution" class="contentitem">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>Corner is a SAAS (software as a service) that features the ability to save and share notes, images, and links, then organize them via tags and ‘boxes’ (a collection of related items). <a href="https://invis.io/D691SM37M">A clickable prototype can be found here</a> <a href="https://inimitabrin.github.io/corner/">and an HTML/CSS version of the homepage here.</a></p>
    </div>
    <div id="process" class="contentitem">
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <h3>survey</h3>
      <p>Corner was my first fully realized design project, and I was eager from the very beginning to apply what I had learned from my background in psychology and graphic design in order to build something new.<br><br>I started by drawing from psychology. There’s a principle called “theory of mind”, which is basically the idea that a person can look at another person and understand that they have different thoughts, feelings, and desires from their own. Most neurotypical people develop this ability when they’re fairly young, but in my experience, many either don’t use it or overestimate its capacity to predict the behavior of other people. The point is, you can’t really know what another person is thinking unless you ask them directly.<br><br>For this reason, I began with a user survey, taken from a sample of fellow designers, friends and family, and an assortment of volunteers from Reddit. In it, I asked about online browsing habits and methods of saving content and taking notes. From this information and a few informal interviews, I created three user personas--the three archetypal people that would become users of Corner.</p>
     <div class="multimages">
       <img class="smallest" src="images/cornerpersona1.png" alt=""/><img class="smallest" src="images/cornerpersona2.png" alt=""/><img class="smallest" src="images/cornerpersona3.png" alt=""/>
     </div>
      <br><br><div class="buttonwrap"><a href="#" class="button">take a closer look</a></div><br><br>
     <p class="one-half va">I also used the responses from this survey to determine what people currently use to take notes and save content. I utilized the SWOT method to determine the strengths and weaknesses of three competitors, which I then integrated into my vision of what Corner would have to be in order to be successful.</p>

     <h3>user flows and sitemaps</h3>
     <p>Corner was beginning to take shape as a concept. It needed to be easy to use, cross-device compatible, and well organized. It was time to take Corner out of the abstract and into the concrete.<br><br>I created user stories for both new and returning users, then used those as a jumping-off point to build the user flows and sitemap for Corner.</p>
     <div class="multimages"><img class="smaller" src="images/corneruserflow.png" alt="The user flows for Corner" /> <img src="images/cornersitemap.png" class="smaller" alt="The sitemap for Corner"/></div>
     <h3>wireframing</h3>
     <p>From there, I was able to start wireframing--low-fidelity wireframes to get the basic layout down, then high-fidelity to flesh out the concepts from the low-fidelity wireframes and give it some real structure.</p>
     <div class="multimages"><img class="smaller" src="images/cornerlowfi.png" alt="An image of a low-fidelity homepage for Corner" /> <img src="images/cornerhifi.png" class="smaller" alt="A high-fidelity homepage for Corner" /></div>
     <h3>branding</h3>
     <p>From there, I knew I needed to test my high-fidelity wireframes to ensure that the flow of everything worked before I moved into Sketch and began on the full design, but first I had to overcome another hurdle: renaming and branding. The project was initially named Blocbox, a nod to the program from which it originated, but I decided to change it up to make the project more my own.</p>
     <p>Eventually, I decided on the name CRNR, but I still had to build a brand for the newly-renamed software. With little to no experience in the matter, I dove into color theory and typography and eventually decided on a color palette and typeface. I also learned about logos and created my own.</p>
     <div class="buttonwrap"><img class="small" src="images/cornerbranding.png" alt="The final style guide for Corner" /></div>
     <h3>user testing</h3>
     <p>As user testing began, it became clear that while the navigation was fairly simple to use and the flow of things was smooth enough, people were getting tripped up on other things. For one, CRNR was almost always read as an initialism, so I changed the name to Corner to avoid confusion and updated the logo. For another, people commented that they weren’t sure about the services that were offered from the homepage, so I worked on improving the copy to make that more clear. When I finally added in color, there were comments that the primary color was too bright, so I also reworked the color palette.</p>
     <div class="buttonwrap"><a class="button" href="https://invis.io/D691SM37M">go to the prototype</a></div>
     <h3>development</h3>
     <p>With these changes implemented, the final step was to build several pages from the site mockup using HTML and CSS--my first foray into development. While the experience was at times frustrating, the satisfaction I felt at creating something tangible was worth it. Finally, I was done with my first real project, and it was time to reflect on all I had done.</p>
     <div class="buttonwrap"><a class="button" href="https://inimitabrin.github.io/corner/">go to the coded homepage</a></div>
    </div>
    <div id="conclusions" class="contentitem">
      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>In retrospect, there are some things I might change were I to revisit Corner. There are some cosmetic changes--the logo probably deserves more space on the homepage, and the illustration I put together for the hero is a bit too loose and doesn’t fit well with the rest of the page. I might change the colors, too, or the copy. But I think what ended up being more important than those things was what I gained.<br><br>Going into the project, despite my excitement, I also felt trepidation. Saying you’re going to do something (like become a UX designer, for example) and actually acting on it are two very different things, and while I knew I would put my best effort into anything I did, I wasn’t entirely certain that all the effort in the world would be able to create anything actually worthwhile.<br><br>But as I worked towards the finish line, as I began to put tools into my toolbox and just do the things I was so nervous about, I discovered that my effort was able to be transformed into something real. So, for all its flaws, I am grateful for Corner, because it gave me the confidence to move forward, to think bigger and brighter and, above all, to put those thoughts into action.</p>
    <div id="next" class="contentitem">
      <h2>So, what's next?</h2>
      <p>The next steps for Corner would be to add in the features that were omitted for the minimum viable product--most notably, a collaborative feature that allows other users to add to and edit the contents of a public box, which would be a helpful solution for teams and social groups. I would also add in a commenting function and a smart tagging system, which users had indicated at the beginning would be desirable in a service like Corner.</p>
