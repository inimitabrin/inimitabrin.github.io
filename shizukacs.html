    <div id="summary" class="contentitem">
      <p>Hoping to alleviate a common difficulty, I researched and designed an app for people with anxiety who want to track and manage their mood.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="problem" class="contentitem">
      <p>Anxiety, according to the <a href="https://www.adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statistics">Anxiety and Depression Association of America</a>, is the most common mental illness in the United States, affecting approximately 18% of adults. Despite being highly receptive to medication and therapy, the disorder frequently goes untreated, and many individuals who are being treated still have difficulty in their daily lives. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="solution" class="contentitem">
      <p>Shizuka allows individuals with anxiety to track their mood to find common trends, as well as provides breathing exercises, distracting and helpful resources, and a place to write down one’s thoughts. The result is an app that is both calming and helpful for users with anxiety. <a href="https://marvelapp.com/259dib4/screen/25978360">The website’s prototype can be found here.</a></p>
    </div>
    <div id="process" class="contentitem">
      <h3>survey</h3>
      <p class="one-half">To gain a better understanding of what individuals with anxiety would want out of an app designed for them, I surveyed a population of people diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. The survey asked about:</p>
      <ul>
     <li>Things that tend to calm anxiety,</li>
     <li>Things that tend to worsen anxiety, and</li>
     <li>Suggestions for a digital anxiety resource.</li> </ul>
     <p>From this survey, I was also able to determine the user demographic that would be most interested in an anxiety application and to collect emails for further questions.</p>
     <img class="one-half graph" src="images/shizukasurvey.png" />
     <p>The survey was incredibly useful in determining what features would be most useful in aiding anxious individuals. For example, respondents indicated that calm colors, non-cluttered environments, breathing exercises, and distractions were most useful in calming their anxiety.</p>
    <h3>personas</h3>
     <p>With these responses in mind, I created three personas based off the demographic information I collected.</p>
     <img class="small" src="images/shizukapersona1.png">
     <br><br><div class="buttonwrap"><a href="inimitabrin.github.io/files/shizukapersonas.pdf" class="button">take a closer look</a></div><br><br><br><br>
     <h3>user flows and stories</h3>
     <p>I created user stories and flows for new and returning users.</p>
     <div class="multimages"><img class="smaller" src="images/shizukauserflow.png" alt="The user flows for Corner" /> <img src="images/shizukauserstories.png" class="smaller" alt="The sitemap for Corner"/></div>
     <h3>competitive analysis</h3>
     <p class="one-half">I also started a competitive analysis to look for opportunities and weaknesses in the current market. Using the SWOT model, I analyzed three different anxiety/depression or mood-mapping apps--Pacifica, Aura, and Self-Help for Anxiety Management.</p>
     <img class="one-half" src="images/shizukaca.png"/>
     <div class="buttonwrap"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IedK1F5V-PjSeLg5L_9lJRuw2qfJEYzkqpqLM7pKq1Q/edit?usp=sharing" class="button">go to analysis</a></div>
     <p>While these apps had their strengths, they lacked community support and often drew from therapeutic techniques like mindfulness therapy (which can be helpful for some people, but lacks some features of most common therapeutic technique for anxiety: cognitive-behavioral therapy).</p>
     <h3>low-fidelity wireframing</h3>
     <p>With a good idea of the features I wanted to include, I created a rough paper wireframe, then sent it out for feedback. Users said they wanted the ability to log thoughts in addition to discarding them.
     <div class="buttonwrap"><a href="inimitabrin.github.io/files/shizukapaperproto.pdf" class="button">go to prototype</a></div>
     <h3>high-fidelity wireframing</h3>
     <p class="one-half">I moved on from the low-fidelity wireframe to a higher-fidelity wireframe, then sent that out for feedback as well. Users and my mentor directed me to change the weekly graphs to a different format, add in a logout button, and to carry the icons from the homepage into the log. At this point I also did a cardsorting study for the loggable moods from the front page, though I ended up scrapping that model later based on another study.</p>
     <img class="one-half" src="images/shizukahifi.png"
     <h3>branding</h3>
     <p>To ascertain which color scheme was more calming, I performed a desirability study with the adjectives "accessible, approachable, boring, busy, calm, clean, comfortable, confusing, difficult, dull, easy to use, effective, energetic, inviting, ordinary, poor quality, predictable, straightforward, trustworthy, unattractive". I was aiming for the following five responses: calm, easy to use, inviting, and effective.</p>
     <div class="multimages"><img class="smaller" src="images/shizukablue.png" alt="A blue variant of the Shizuka colors" /><img class="smaller" src="images/shizukagreen.png" alt="The final color scheme for Shizuka" /></div>
     <p>The green color scheme ended up getting responses closer to those five, so I went with that one and created a logo based off a brainstorming session, mostly focused around calming images and especially focused on Japanese gardens. I had already decided on the name from the beginning--it's a Japanese word that means quiet, silent, slow, unhurried, calm, or peaceful, which is fitting for the aim of this app.</p>
     <div class="multimages"><img class="smaller" src="images/shizukalogos.jpg" alt="Several different ideas for the Shizuka logo" /><img class="smaller" src="images/shizukabranding.png" alt="The final style guide for Shizuka" /></div>
     <h3>visual design</h3>
     <p class="one-half">I added in the decided-upon color scheme and sent it out for a final round of feedback. User responses made it clear that the abundance of emotions I was working with wasn't popular, so I did a preference test between the multi-emotion logging model and a simpler spectrum model. Respondents on that test responded far better to the spectrum model, so I switched it over to that and, upon suggestion from my mentor, changed the faces on it to be less clinical and more animated.</p>

     <div class="buttonwrap"><a class="button" href="https://marvelapp.com/259dib4/screen/25978360">go to finished prototype</a></div>
    </div>
    <div id="conclusions" class="contentitem">
      <p>This was my favorite project up to this point because I got to do all the research I wanted, ensuring that every point in the app was backed up by actual data. I learned that models that make sense for some apps don't necessarily carry over well to others. I also learned more about the iOS Human Interface Guidelines and about the importance of keeping your users in mind at all times.</p>
    <div id="next" class="contentitem">
      <p>The next step for Shizuka would be development and production. Like Lunch Break, it revolves a lot around user interaction, so ensuring that it was publicized and then kept the users it gained would be very important. I would also probably make the user interface slightly cleaner and more complex before its release.</p>
